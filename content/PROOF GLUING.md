Let's consider an indexed set of proof procedures $(L_{\alpha}, \scr{A}_{{\alpha}})$ where $L$ is the proof skeleton (i.e., an isomorphism class) and $\scr{A}$ is the proof environment (a symmetric monoidal category with some further bells and whistles), indexed by some net $A$. For instance a  proof "step" $L_{\alpha_{i}}$ may be modeled as a compatibility map (say, for $i= j+k$)  $L_{\alpha_{i}}: A_{j} \otimes  A_{k} \to A_{i}$
